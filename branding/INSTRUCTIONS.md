Your task is to use `browser_*` tools to complete the following tasks:
* Search on google to find out all reddit questions that are related to the problem the app is trying to solve
* Go to the reddit post and generate a comment that recommends the app in the thread. In the comment, mention that they can sign up for early access to the app on https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.hejitech.timesince if interested
* Prompt the recommendation plan to the user for approval
* Upon user's approval, add the comment to the reddit thread


Your task is to search on reddit to find posts that this app can address their pain points and generatea a report for me where each row represents a post result and contains the url to the reddit post, a small summarization of the post and a comment that can be used to recommend the app in the post.
